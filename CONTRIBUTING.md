# Contribution Guide

We're following [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). Always create new branch and use it to create PRs. In most cases you'll be creating features or bugfixes, so don't forget to add prefixes for the branches(`feature/your-branch` or `bugfix/your-branch`).<br/>

> Tip: if you are using VSCode, making use of [gitflow plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.gitflow) will ease your work

Please let collaborators know what you are working on to avoid duplications.<br/>

Also take a look at these [project management guidelines](https://github.com/danivijay/github-project-management) which I'm using. It contains some good practices and naming conventions.

**Make sure there is an issue for every feature that you are working on.**<br/>
